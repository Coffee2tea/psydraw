I want you to integrate the following individual analyses into a comprehensive psychological profile based on the House-Tree-Person test.

Here are the analyses to integrate:

## Overall Analysis
{overall_analysis}

## House Analysis
{house_analysis}

## Tree Analysis
{tree_analysis}

## Person Analysis
{person_analysis}

Based on these individual analyses, provide an integrated psychological profile that identifies consistent themes, contrasts, developmental level, emotional indicators, defenses, cognitive functioning, interpersonal patterns, and areas of concern.
